<Your response>

I was doing internship at intellectionstudio.com. I was fixing bugs on the main website. On my first week of the internship, I was assigned to fix bugs. The first task was to fix a video bug. The video on the main page was not playing when the size of the screen was changing. Therefore, firstly I had to watch a video lecture on udacity about Responsive Web design to understand how to cope with this problem, because they were using this techniques in intergrating this video. The main lessons I took from it, was the min-width, max-width in css for the components of the website, where you have to adjust all the components one by one for different screen sizes. 

The previous implementation had several issues. They couldn't find the bug, because they thought the problem was in css. Actually, problem was
with the image on the background of the video. When I started to 'turn off' the components of the website to find a bug, I found that the problem is not in css. So, I looked at the video component itself and made the same procedure. After, I found that the background image of the video was making clash with the video for different screen sizes. So, that caused the problem. Finally, I  decided to remove the background image and everything worked well.
